/**
 * A visual org chart built from the same supervisor_id hierarchy used for
 * visibility scoping (Employee::scopeVisibleTo()). Deliberately reuses that
 * scope rather than a separate "show everyone" query: a Supervisor's chart
 * shows exactly the same people they can already see elsewhere (themselves
 * plus their direct reports), while Administrator/People Development see
 * the whole company since they hold ViewAllEmployees.
 *
 * For everyone else, the scoped set alone would show them as a root with no
 * one above them, which reads as "I'm at the top of the company" - wrong,
 * and unhelpful for placing themselves in it. So their upward supervisor
 * chain (to the top) is added on top of the scoped set, without pulling in
 * any of their supervisors' other reports (siblings/unrelated branches).
 *
 * The Plant Manager is hidden from every other employee screen (see
 * ExcludePlantManagerScope) but is the head of this chart, so it opts back
 * in here: added for org-wide viewers, and reached through the ancestor
 * chain for everyone else.
